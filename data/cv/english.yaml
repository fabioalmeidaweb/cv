about:
  label: About Me
  values:
    - I am a professional Drupal specialist with extensive experience as a developer and Tech Lead. My expertise includes advanced knowledge in module development, theme creation, and integrations with other systems and APIs. I am highly skilled in Drupal architecture, development standards, performance optimization, and scalability, ensuring robust and maintainable solutions.
    - In addition to my Drupal expertise, I have advanced skills in ReactJS, focusing on modern web application development. This includes Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG) using frameworks like Next.js and Gatsby.js. I apply best practices in development and architecture to deliver scalable and high-performance solutions.
    - With a strong foundation in both Drupal and ReactJS, I specialize in delivering full-stack solutions tailored to client needs, ensuring quality, maintainability, and scalability in every project.
